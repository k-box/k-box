# Geographical Extension

This package provides support for geographical data, e.g. GeoJson, KML, Shapefile. 
The support is given using a [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) integration.

In particular this package will offer:

- Upload
- Preview
- Download

> **This is highly experimental**, the integration is disabled by default. Can be enabled with `php artisan dms:flags --enable geo`
