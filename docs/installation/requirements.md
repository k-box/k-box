## Hardware requirements

- Memory: 2GB RAM minimum; suggested 4 GB.
- Minimum of 5GB of free storage space for installation.
- CPU: x86-64 processor. H264 acceleration is optional, but recommended if the optional video streaming service is enabled.

## Software Requirements

In order to run the K-Link the following Software is needed:

- Operating system [supported by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/faq/#does-docker-run-on-linux-macos-and-windows) (we recommend GNU/Linux and we use [Debian](https://debian.org))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Browser requirements

For actions/components that requires a web browser, the K-Link support modern web browser: Edge 15+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera together with their mobile counterparts.

## Storage

The K-Box requires 5GB of free space for the [installation](./installation.md). This requirement is generated by the use of Docker images, which are serving the packaged code of the K-Box components.

The storage of documents requires additional space on disk. As a document management platform, we suggest to have at least 200GB of disk space that can be used for documents storage.

Beside the storage required to download the code and to save the documents, the K-Box uses storage space for:

- _the Database_. The database is used to store user accounts and all the organization of the documents:
- _the Search Engine_. The Search Engine creates an index of all document contents to perform document retrieval;
in addition all components stores log information

The used storage space varies according to the usage of the K-Box itself.
