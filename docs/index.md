## K-Box Architecture

The K-Box architecture is based on components:

1. The K-Box Application
2. The database
3. The [K-Search](https://github.com/k-box/k-search) and its [engine](https://github.com/k-box/k-search-engine/)

The K-Box (web) Application is the user facing part, while the K-Search offers the full text based retrieval of documents.
