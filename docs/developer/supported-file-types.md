# Supported File Types

Here is the comprehensive list of supported mime types and their associated file extension.

In the table with *Is Searchable* we mean that can be added to the K-Link Core and the Core can extract text from the document and perform search over that text. With *Is Previewable* we mean that the K-Box can show a preview of the content of the file (this is not the thumbnail).

Possible values for *Is Searchable*:

- basic: Search will include file name and title (plus some metadata depending on the file type)
- normal: Search will include the content of the file
- advanced: Advanced features are supported

Possible values for *Is Previewable*:

- yes: You will get a preview of the file content inside the K-Box
- partial: You will get a link to the file preview
- no: You are not able to get a preview of the file's content
