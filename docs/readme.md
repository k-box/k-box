# K-Box Documentation

* Documentation will be stored in the repository
* Documentation will be written using in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* To be complete, a story must have its documentation done. Hence, features, code and their documentations are always at the same at the same revision
* The documentation file structure will be (as a start)

```
|-- docs
    |-- user
        |-- en
            |-- Introduction
            |-- changelog
            |-- environment setup
        |-- ru
            |-- Introduction

    |-- developer
        |-- environment setup
        |-- database
        |-- frontend

```

* Developers will update `developer` documentation
* PO and Help desk will update end-user guides i.e. the `user` part
* Every release is tagged, using git's tag command
