Title: Log in
Description:

To log-in into a K-Box, [register](./registration.md) an account manually or with a pre-configured third party provider.

## Manual Log-in

You can log-in using email and password. For this purpose, an account must be present, created either by you using the registration form or by the administrator on your behalf. A password must be set in your profile.

## Log-in with third party providers

The K-Box administrator can decide to enable third party providers, also called OAuth services.
If a third party provider is enabled, click the icon for that service (i.e., Gitlab or Dropbox), and then follow the on-screen prompts to log-in.

Logging in is allowed if the account was created using the same provider. If you 
[connected multiple providers](./connect-identities.md) under your K-Box profile 
all of them can be used for log in.

## Password recovery

The K-Box can assist in password recovery of your account. 
On the log-in screen click `Forgot your password?`. You will be asked to enter the email address used at the time
of the account registration. If an account with that email address exists, an email with a link to reset the
password will be sent. The link is valid only for 60 minutes and can be used only once.

In case you registered using a third party identity provider, you must specify the email address you had and the
provider used at the time of registration. For example if you registered using Gitlab with `my@email.address` 
you must enter that email address.
If you connected multiple identities, e.g. Gitlab and Dropbox, you can log-in with the other identity and set a
password under your profile.
