The K-Box is a web application designed for handling document management inside an Organization.

## How it works

The K-Box architecture is based on components:

1. The K-Box Application
2. The database
3. The [K-Search](https://github.com/k-box/k-search) engine

The K-Box (web) Application is the user facing part, while the K-Search offers the full text based retrieval of documents uploaded in the K-Box Application.
