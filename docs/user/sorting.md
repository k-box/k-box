## Sorting

Exploring documents is personal, everyone does this differently. Sorting gives
freedom to explore your way and get to documents quicker. Paired with search
filters and keyword enhances your experience.

Sorting is available for document in My Uploads, Recent, Starred, inside a 
Collection or a Project and under the Shared with me section.

When sorting is enabled you will see a button with the sorting options and, 
if detail visualization is selected, sortable columns will be clickable.


## What I can sort

Sorting is currently limited to:

- Document title or file name
- Last modification date
- Creation date
- [Document type](./document-types.md)
- Language

In the _Shared with me_ section the following options are also available:

- Shared date, i.e. the date when the share was created
- Shared by, i.e. the user that shared the document/collection

> Not all options might be available, check the _Sort by_ menu in the
section to see the available ones.

## Default sorting

The default sorting is based on the document's last modified date 
and follows the newest first order, except in the _Sahred with me_
section were shares are ordered by share creation date.

## Sorting in searches

When performing a search, i.e. using a keyword or apply a filter, the
documents are ordered by relevance, with the most relevant documents
first. The relevance is based on the full text search which considers
keyword placement, match of all keywords and other factors.

Beside relevance to the search criteria the following options 
are available:

- Document title or file name
- Last modification date
- Creation date
- Language

Unavailable options might be showed, but are not selectable.
