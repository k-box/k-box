# Projects

Projects help to create communities of users who share a common goal. Projects can contain documents and collections, 
accessible by authorized users, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Projects are created and maintained by Project Managers and K-Box Administrators.

## Projects section

Project management is performed from the _Projects_ page. If your profile has Project Management capabilities, 
you will see the _New Project_ button

## Create a new Project

To create a project, press the button _New Project_ that is on the top right of the page:
