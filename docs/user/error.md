**1. I have uploaded same document more than once.**

Yes, that is possible. Whenever more duplicates are added to projects, uploader will see a respective badge signaling duplication. 

**2. There are duplicates. How can I resolve them?**

Only the uploader of the duplicate can resolve it. Please contact the uploader. 

**3. “Cannot delete Collection”**

Only Project administrator can perform such an action.

**4. “Gateway timeout”**

Poor internet connection results in delay of response from K-Link server.

**5. “Loading problem. Some functionalities may not be available.”**

This message will be showed in case of internet connectivity delay or blocked response. Refreshing the page normally solves the problem.

**6. “File preview cannot be showed” or “File preview error”**

The preview of a file is available only for selected file types. At now only PDF, MP4 video, JPG and PNG images are well supported. Microsoft Word Documents (created using Office 2010 or above using the Open XML format) might raise an error due some elements of the Word processing format not supported or being showed with partial formatting.

**7. Drag and dropped file is opening instead**

This behavior emerges with some browsers and is caused by the fact that the file has been drag and dropped outside of the upload sensible area. The upload area covers the whole page and is surrounded by a green border. If you’re in doubt drag and drop on the center of the screen, where the documents are listed.

**8. I shared a link to an uploaded file. Why do my colleagues not have access to it?**

Most likely the conditions listed under [sharing](./share.md) are not fullfiled. You can check the Sharing settings to see who has access.
