# Invite users

You can invite users to join the K-Box. The invite, if user registration is allowed, will 
let the person create an account.

> A K-Box instance can be configured to allow account creation only upon invite.

> Invites can be created only if user registration is allowed on the specific K-Box instance.

## Creating an invite

Invite can be created by any logged-in users. 

The invites are created from the "Invite" section under the user profile and require only the person email address.

> To send an invite a verified email address is required. You will be prompted to verify your email address if needed.

1. Go to your profile, by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner and choose "Profile"
2. Enter the _Invite_ section
3. Click on the _Invite a person_ button
4. Type the person email address and click "Invite"

The page will refresh and show the list of created invites. The email address is verified for validity, 
in case of errors check if the typed email address is correct and retry.

## Verifying that an invite was accepted

The user has plenty of time to accept the invitation (15 days by default), so it might accept at anytime.
To check for status updates go to the _Invite_ section under your profile to see the status updates.

There are two states for an invite:

- _pending_ the invite has been sent, but the user didn't start the registration process
- _accepted_ the person accepted the invitation and a user account was created

## Revoking an invite

You can revoke any pending invites at anytime:

1. Go to your profile, by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner and choose "Profile"
2. Enter the _Invite_ section
3. Find the invite you want to delete and click _"Remove invite"_

A deleted invite will immediately invalidate the link contained in the email communication.

## Validity

An invite is not valid anymore if one of the following conditions are met:

- the invite was already used and an account was created
- the invite was older than 15 days (the expiration is considered at the midnight of the day)
- the invite was deleted by its creator.

## Limitations

Invites are limited to account registration. Currently is not possible to invite users directly to
join projects or to receive a share. Subsequent actions needs to be performed manually after the user 
accepted the invitation.
