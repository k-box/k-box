# Sharing

If _Who has Access_ is set to `Only authenticated users can access` , the recipient should appear in the list. 

If _Who has Access_ is set to `Anyone with link can access`, go ahead and send the link. The recipient will not appear in the list. The latter is true for Public documents, too.

If file is [public](./publish.md), anyone will be able to view it. 

The list of users having access to the document is available in the same sharing dialog window.
