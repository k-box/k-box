# Sharing

If _Who has Access_ is set to `Only authenticated users can access` , the recipient should appear listed in the list. 

If _Who has Access_ is set to `Anyone with link can access`, go ahead and send the link. The recipient will not appear in the list. The latter is true for Public documents, too.
