## Upload

To add a new document, select the collection or sub-collection in which the document will be stored.


There are several options for uploading a file into K-Box:

1. For videos use the "Create or Add"  → “Video uploader" option

## <a id="edit"></a>Edit meta-data

By clicking on a document, you access its [meta-information](./meta-data.md).

Select "Edit" to change title, author, language, version, [resolve duplicates](https://git.klink.asia/main/k-box/blob/Update-Help-Project-section/docs/user/documents/duplicates.md#resolve) or assign license to your file.


## Edit file
If you want to edit a document, you can download it, edit it offline and upload it again, by using the button _Upload a new version_ on the metadata page. Note that if you upload an already existing document (by drag-and-dropping or by using the Upload a new version), your file will be identified as a [_duplicate_](https://git.klink.asia/main/k-box/blob/Update-Help-Project-section/docs/user/documents/duplicates.md#resolve). 


## Organization of files

Click on your file to get an overview of all assigned collections. To add a file to a collection, simply drag and drop it onto one. 

Hit the “X” symbol to remove collection.
