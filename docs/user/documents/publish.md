### K-Link Network

K-Link technology allows users to organize themselves in public or closed networks for easier sharing of relevant information and documents. Examples are the [K-Link](https://klink.asia/) and [SLM Tajikistan](https://slmtj.net/) networks.

### To publish

_Note: To prevent sharing of unauthorized files (private, confidential, etc.), only users with permissions of project manager can employ the feature. Please contact your Project Administrator via email, indicating the file you would like to make public._

In order to make a file visible in the K-Link network, please do the right-click on the document, select "Publish", click the "globe" icon. As soon as the icon changes from "lock" to "globe" - the file is published.  Or you can go to the [sharing settings](./share.md) of the file and hit the "globe" icon. 

### Reverse to private

_Note: Only users with permissions of project manager can perform this operation. Please contact your Project Administrator via email, indicating the document you would like to make private._

One can unpublish files only from the same K-Box they are physically stored in. In order to do that, go the [sharing settings](./share.md) of the file and hit the "lock" icon. As soon as the icon changed from “globe” to “lock”, your file is private again.
