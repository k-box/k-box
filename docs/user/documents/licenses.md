# License and Copyright

### Copyright owner

As a general rule, the copyright over work is initially owned by its creator. This is not always the case. For instance, if an author wants to publish their manuscript in a journal, they will have to conclude a publishing agreement. 

According to the agreement, author transfers copyright to the publisher and will be capable of disseminating the original manuscript for non-commercial purposes only.

A concrete example of the policy is presented on the [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/copyright) website.

### License

License provides information about the terms and conditions for a document/work use by third parties as specified by the copyright owner. Licenses help to protect the work from copyright infringement. Due to their legal value, they also allow the copyright owner to avoid giving use permissions on case by case basis.

### When should I indicate a license or copyright owner information?

The copyright owner and license information should be indicated as soon as a work is shared, or disseminated with other users through K-Box. It is strongly recommended to add that information before a work is shared in a public space.

### Custom license

If you miss a license, which is not listed under available options, contact K-Box Administrator and provide as much information as possible about it.
