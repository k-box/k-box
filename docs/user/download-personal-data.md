# Personal data package

The K-Box let you export all your personal data, plus the files you uploaded, as a single zip archive.

The export will contain your user data, the documents uploaded (metadata and files), 
the starred documents, the collections and your managed projects.

> **The export can only be generated after verifying your email address**

## Generating an export

You can request the generation of an export from the "Personal Data Export" section under your profile area.

> one request per hour can be submitted

Since the generation of your personal data export can take some time, you will receive an email 
notification once is ready for download.

You can periodically check the "Personal Data Export" to see if a download is available and start the
package download.

## Expired exports

The generated packages have an expiration. Depending on the system configuration it can vary from days to weeks.
Within the user interface the expiration date is reported for each existing and pending export. After
the expiration date the generated exports will be permanently removed from the system and can no 
longer be downloaded.
