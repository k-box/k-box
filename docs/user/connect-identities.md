Title: Connect and manage third party identities
Description: 
Since: next

The K-Box can allow the connection of third party services to your profile. These services
are currently used for log-in purposes.

## Connect an identity

For your profile navigate to the `Connected identities` section. Click on the provider of your choice, 
i.e. Gitlab or Dropbox (the provider list depends on the K-Box configuration as selected by the administrator).

You will be redirected to the provider log in page, e.g. Gitlab, and you will be asked to authorize the `K-Box application` to read your user information. The only required information are the _name_, the _email_. These information
will be used to create a link with your existing account and will not be saved on the K-Box. Once linked you can
log in with that provider without inserting the email and password manually.

You can [unlink](#unlink-an-identity) the third party identity or revoke the K-Box authorization at any time.

## Unlink an identity

On the listed identities click the `Unlink` button and follow the on screen messages.

Once unlinked you will not be able to use it for login or registration as the K-Box account will remain active.
