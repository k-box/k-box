# Help

The K-Box contributors maintain an help section in the [Open Source project](https://github.com/k-box/k-box/tree/master/docs). 
Each K-Box have a short _help_ section reachable through the navigation menu in the footer.

You can always get in touch with the community if you encounter a bug or an problem by posting an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/k-box/k-box/issues).

> If the K-Box is hosted by an organization you might be able to have a contact with a dedicated support team. Check the contact page published on the K-Box.
