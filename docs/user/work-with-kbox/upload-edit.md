## Upload

To add a new document, select the collection or sub-collection in which the document will be stored.


There are several options for uploading a file into K-Box:

For _videos_ use the "Create or Add"  → “Upload Video" option

## <a id="edit"></a>Edit meta-data

By clicking on a document, you access its [meta-information](./meta-data.md).

Select "Edit" to change title, author, language, version, [resolve duplicates](./duplicates.md#resolve) or assign [license](./licenses.md#license) to your file.


## Edit file
If you want to edit a document, you can download it, edit it offline and upload it again, by using the button _Upload a new version_ on the metadata page. Note that if you upload an already existing document (by drag-and-dropping or by using the Upload a new version), your file will be identified as a [_duplicate_](./duplicates.md#resolve). 

## Delete file

If you want to delete file, do a right click on the selected file and click on "Move to Trash" option.

## Organization of files

You can organize your files in accessible projects, in "My Collections" and [other sections](./getting-started.md). Private collections are colored green for distinction from project collections (orange). Please do right-click on the collection where you intend to create an internal structuring, select "New Collection". Hit the arrow-like symbol on the collection to see the subcollections.

K-Box collections behave differently from folders in the following way:
- You can assign your document to more than one collection  
- Changes to the file will be visible in all assigned collections

Click on your file to get an overview of all assigned collections. To add a file to a collection, simply drag and drop it onto one. 

Hit the “X” symbol to remove collection.
