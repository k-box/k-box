# Sharing
K-Box sharing options are available through the Sharing window, that can be accessed through:

_Share_ button on the top navigation bar

or _Share_ option in the right-hand menu

![share-menu](../img/share-menu.PNG)

or _Sharing settings_ on details panel

![share-panel](../img/share-panel.PNG)


If _Who has Access_ is set to **Only authenticated users can access** , the recipient should appear in the following list.

If _Who has Access_ is set to **Anyone with link can access**, go ahead and send the link. 
The recipient will not appear in the following list. 

The latter is true for Public documents, too.
