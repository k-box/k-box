# Users management

## Account types

The K-Box user management is based on [permissions](./permissions.md). 
To facilitate the user creation the permissions are grouped into three roles:

1. Partner: Can upload, edit and share files. Has access to shared Projects and Personal space
2. Project Manager: Has all _Partner_ permission, plus can manage projects and publish (or unpublish) data to the K-Link
3. K-Box Administrator: Has all permissions and can manage users and the K-Box configuration

> For all the available permissions, please refer to the [Permissions List](./permissions.md)
