## Installation

K-Box can be installed on most operating systems. The setup is heavily based on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

### Prerequisites

- Check the [system requirements](./docs/installation/requirements.md).
- Use an operating system [supported by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#server) (ideally GNU/Linux; we use [Debian](https://debian.org))
- Make sure you have installed the latest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Simplest installation

These few commands allow you to quickly install a K-Box **locally** on your computer for testing purposes.

* Create a directory: `mkdir k-box && cd k-box`
* Download configuration file: `curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k-box/k-box/master/docker-compose.example.yml`
* Start up services: `docker-compose up -d` (when running this for the first time, it will download a lot of data and take a while)
* Create the administrator: `docker-compose exec kbox php artisan create-admin admin@kbox.local` 
* Visit your K-Box: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) (you can login to the K-Box with the username `admin@kbox.local` and the chosen password).

For installation on a server in the Internet or more configuration options, see the documentation on [installation of the K-Box](./docs/user/installation.md).
